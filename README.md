## Notes
This game was made with [Processing](https://processing.org/), an awesome Java based language/library. You need it to run this game!
## How to Play
Click/hold down left mouse button to shoot in the direction of your mouse pointer, pushing you in the opposite direction that you shoot.
Gradually more and more enemies will spawn. They can be killed by shooting them or ramming into them if you are going fast enough.
By killing enemies, you add to your combo, seen on the top right hand corner. If you don't get a kill within 5 seconds after getting a kill, your combo is halved. Every second, your combo is added to your score, seen on the top left.
If you get hit 3 times, the game is over, and your score is displayed on the top left.
